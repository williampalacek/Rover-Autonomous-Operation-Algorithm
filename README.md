# Rover Autonomous Operation Algorithm

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the Rover Autonomous Operation Algorithm, a sophisticated project undertaken for APSC 103 at Queen's University. The algorithm is part of a broader initiative by the Queen's Space Engineering Team (QSET) targeting enhancements in autonomous navigation for a Mars rover prototype. It leverages a combination of sensors, including cameras and LiDAR, to navigate challenging terrains autonomously. This software is designed for integration with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and supports deployment on simulated platforms as well as potential real-world applications.

## Code Documentation
The algorithm is thoroughly documented, detailing the operational framework of each module within ROS for autonomous navigation and obstacle detection.

## Compatibility
This software is compatible with **Python version 2.7.17**. Ensure your development environment is set up with this Python version to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Proprietary Library: QSET Lib
The Rover Autonomous Operation Algorithm utilizes a proprietary library, **QSET lib**, which is essential for its functionality. The QSET Lib can be accessed and downloaded from the following GitLab repository: [https://gitlab.com/qset-mod-3/qset-lib](https://gitlab.com/qset-mod-3/qset-lib). Please ensure to include this library in your project setup for proper operation of the algorithm.

## Gazebo Simulation
The necessary files for running the Rover simulation in Gazebo can be found at the following GitLab repository: [https://gitlab.com/qset-mod-3/unified-launch](https://gitlab.com/qset-mod-3/unified-launch). These files are crucial for simulating the rover's autonomous operations in a virtual environment.

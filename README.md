# Rover Autonomous Operation Algorithm

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the Rover Autonomous Operation Algorithm, a sophisticated project undertaken for APSC 103 at Queen's University. The algorithm is part of a broader initiative by the Queen's Space Engineering Team (QSET) targeting enhancements in autonomous navigation for a Mars rover prototype. It leverages a combination of sensors, including cameras and LiDAR, to navigate challenging terrains autonomously. This software is designed for integration with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and supports deployment on simulated platforms as well as potential real-world applications.

## Code Documentation
The algorithm is thoroughly documented, detailing the operational framework of each module within ROS for autonomous navigation and obstacle detection.

## License
The project is available under the MIT License. For full license details, refer to the LICENSE.md file.
